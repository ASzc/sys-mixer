# SYS Mixer

The SYS Mixer is a conversion board for the SYS from Schitt Audio. It turns it
into a passive line-level audio mixer, rather than switching between the inputs
in a binary manner.

The pushbutton switch selects which channel the variable resistor attenuates.
Only one channel can be attenuated at one time, due the limitations of the
SYS's default control layout.
